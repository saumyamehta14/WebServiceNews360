How to run this example

1. Downlaod the file from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0cMxo7fjtlYN0hYSk8tLVpycDQ) 
2. Extract the file in to the project folder and name it `data.csv` ( if the name is something else )

Build & Run the application using the following command
````
docker-compose build
````
````
docker-compose up
```` 
3. To  import the data from `data.csv` go to [https://0.0.0.0:5000/import-data/](https://0.0.0.0:5000/import-data). Alternatively to run the mongodb in debug mode and import the data uncomment the `monogdb()` funtion in the main function()
   
   
   Note:- For demo purposes when the docker conatiner is build and ran the program starts importing data to mongodb in debug mode and is imported every time you run `docker-compose up`. Comment __mongodb()__ in the __main__ function in app.py
